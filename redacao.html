        <h1>Yago Aparecido</h1>
        <h2>Me and my world!</h2><hr>
        <h3><u>Presentation</u></h3>
        <p>Hi, everyone.  My name is Yago Aparecido, I am 30 years old, and I am a student in the Technical Course in Internet Computing. I like to be helpful and learn about everything, from the most trivial to the most complex things. It's not always an easy task, but I see it as a challenge for my development.</p>
        <p>I view my personal and professional progress like a sandcastle: <blockquote><em>The tide will rise, the waves will come, but my sandcastle will stand as long as I keep filling it with sand.</em></blockquote> Essentially, as long as I continue moving forward and learning from the problems and obstacles along the way, I will steadily progress toward my destiny.</p>
        <h3><u>Goals</u></h3>
        <h4>- <mark>Personal Life</mark></h4>
        <p>I seek balance and peace, keeping in mind that my life is a finite cycle, and that enjoying the little things in everyday life is as important as major events. Respect is something as valuable as life, and respecting what I don't understand in a world that encourages the opposite is one of my goals to become a better person.</p>
        <h4>- <mark>Professional Life</mark></h4>
        <p>Organization, assertiveness, focus, calmness, and planning define me as a professional. Taking the time to pause, breathe, and consider other solutions, as well as consistently seeking alternatives, and ultimately, respecting the period of concentration without letting it consume me entirely.</p>
